# DeathManager

## About

DeathManager is a plugin that allows Staff Members to log data about Player Deaths.

When a player dies, DeathManager will log the following information to a Table with the name of their UUID in
an SQLite Database:

- The location (X, Y, Z) of the death.
- The name of the world the player died in.
- A serialized copy of the players inventory.

This information can then be retrieved at a later date by Staff Members. They also have the option of 
restoring the players inventory, if they deem necessary.

## Compilation

Compilation Steps are currently unavailable until a production release of the plugin can be made. Please
check back at a later date, when the plugin has been further developed.
